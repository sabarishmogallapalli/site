Quick Setup
Ensure you have Node.js installed. Check your installation by running:

node -v
In the project directory, install dependencies:

npm install
Start the development server:

npm start
Open http://localhost:3000 to view the app in the browser.

Customize the template by navigating to the /src/components directory. Modify texts, pictures, and other information as needed.

The page will reload if you make edits, and you will see any lint errors in the console.

If you are interested in creating a mockup image like the ones from the personal projects section, I recommend Genmoo. This website lets you generate sleek looking browser mockups for free.

Deployment
You can choose your preferred service (e.g., Netlify, Render, Heroku) for deployment. One of the easiest ways to host this portfolio is using GitHub Pages. Follow the instructions below for a production deploy.

Set Up GitHub Repository

Create a new repository on GitHub for your portfolio app.

Configure package.json

Edit the following properties in your package.json file:

{
    "homepage": "https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo-name",
    "scripts": {
        "predeploy": "npm run build",
        "deploy": "gh-pages -d build",
        ...
    }
}
Replace yourusername with your GitHub username and your-repo-name with the name of your GitHub repository.

Deploy to GitHub Pages

Run the following command to deploy your app:

npm run deploy
Access Your Deployed App

After successfully deploying, you can access your app at https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo-name.
